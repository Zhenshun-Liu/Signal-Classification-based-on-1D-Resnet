# Signal-Classification-based-on-1D-Resnent
This project was used to signal classification competition.
## Introduction to the competition
Bearing has three kinds of faults: outer ring fault, inner ring fault, ball fault, plus normal working state. As shown in Table 1, combined with the three diameters of bearings (diameter 1, diameter 2 and diameter 3), there are 10 types of working conditions of bearings.</br>
